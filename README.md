Hello, and welcome to the Spelling Test Repository of my Personal Projects 🖐️

This program was designed for my children to have a fun/interactive way to practice their spelling words for school.

> 📌 To get started:
👉 download the Words zipped folder and place it into the desired eclipse workspace.
👉 Extract the zipped folder to the same location.
👉 In eclipse (workspace previosuly chosen), import the project by navigating to import from the main file menu.
👉 Under General, Select Existing Projects into Workspace
👉 Select Select the extracted Words Folder
👉 Select the Words folder
👉 Select Finish

👉 Once the project is imported, ensure your run configuration is set for Java Application, and then the program should be ready to run!

📌 The program driver is Driver.java

📌 Follow the instructions as prompted for the program to create the needed resource file for the program to function correctly.

📌 The best way for all information to be saved correctly is to exit the program from the program's main menu.
Not doing so, will cause changes to not be saved. (Feature update coming soon.)

I Hope you enjoy! I certainly enjoyed making it and watching my children use it!
