Hello, and welcome to the Spelling Test Repository of my Personal Projects üñêÔ∏è

This program was designed for my children to have a fun/interactive way to practice their spelling words for school.

To get started, simply import the Words folder into Eclipse. The program driver is Driver.java
Follow the instructions as prompted for the program to create the needed resource file for the program to function correctly.

The best way for all information to be saved correctly is to exit the program from the program's main menu.
Not doing so, will cause changes to not be saved. (Feature update coming soon.)

I Hope you enjoy! I certainly enjoyed making it and watching my children use it!
